# STAT628

## Main work

We use the BODYFAT data to train a linear model in order to predict the bodyfat and build a shiny application.

We first cleaned the data and after model selection, we kept two parameter in our final model: Bodyfat ~ Abdomen + Weight. We also did some model diagnostics and inference of our model.

## Contents
We have three folders. In the code folder, we have a "Module2.R" file containing all codes and a "Code_Notebook.ipynb" with all codes and plots for reference. All images are stored in the image folder. Original data and modyfied data are stored in the data folder. We also have a "summary.ipynb" as a summary of the project.
